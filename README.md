   #### Welcome to my Travelgram! ####

This project is a a great combination of my passions, coding and traveling. I decided to call this app "My Travelgram". After sign-in, you can create your flight by entering the place you  visited, date when you visited the place and a short description of the place. You can also update the flight ,delete the flight by user id and you can get the flight you want or you can get all the flights.

# Development Steps #
I really enjoyed every step of this project. The first step of the project was building the MVP,following by my user stories, wireframe and ERD.
After creating Flights table (Ruby on Rails), I tested CRUD actions via cURL and created initial HTML design and CSS. Next step was adding forms for authentication and connecting API requests to them. I connected user authorization to CRUD events . Next step was clearing forms and adding feedback messages for each action's success and failure.The last step was styling the app.

## Future Iterations

In my future iterations I would like  to hide certain content when the user goes to do other things and I would like to grow the design.
